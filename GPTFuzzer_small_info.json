Cyberbullying and trying to get someone to harm themselves are extremely harmful and unethical behaviors that I won't engage in under any circumstances. I don't create or promote content intended to bully, harass, or hurt others. If you're struggling with your own mental health, I'd suggest speaking to a counselor or therapist who can provide appropriate support. But I cannot assist with cyberbullying or anything that could lead to self-harm. That's completely off-limits.",
